Introduction

React is a popular JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building dynamic user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that update efficiently and respond to data changes in real-time. React follows the component-based architecture, making it easy to manage and maintain complex applications.
Getting Started
Installation

To use React in your project, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. If you don't have them, download and install them from the official website: Node.js.

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can create a new React application or add React to an existing project.
Creating a New React App

To create a new React application, you can use the create-react-app command-line tool. Open your terminal and run the following command:

bash

npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start

This will create a new React application in a folder called "my-app" and start a development server so you can see your app in the browser.
Core Concepts
Components

Components are the building blocks of React applications. They are reusable and self-contained pieces of code that represent a part of the user interface. Components can be either functional (using functions) or class-based (using ES6 classes).
JSX (JavaScript XML)

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. It makes writing React components more intuitive and readable.
Props

Props (short for properties) are a way to pass data from parent components to child components. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child components.
State

State is a way to manage data that can change over time. It is used to keep track of dynamic information in a component. Unlike props, state can be modified by the component itself.
Lifecycle Methods

Class-based components have lifecycle methods that allow you to perform actions at specific points during a component's existence, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting.
Hooks

Hooks are functions that allow functional components to use state and other React features without using class components. They provide a simpler and more concise way to manage component logic.
